# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

TODO - The title of the project will be Stock Financial Analysis Tool.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

TODO - This project will allow user to input the name of the stock and give you multitude of financial information that can help you have a smarter investment decisions.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

TODO - The program will allow user to enter a stock name. Then the progra will use Yahoo Finance and retreive the information from the web. This will done through a few function like pandas, pandas_datareader,datetime, and more. Once the data is imported it will generate a useful chart. This information could help you make a smarter investment. If we have extra time we want we add onto the program, prompting the user to current amount and stock the user want to get. Also we want to add this program is some sort of website.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable - I will not planning to combine this final project with another of my other course.

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable - Christian Riedl,tuk88750@temple.edu,Tamara Katic

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

TODO - A program that allow user to input stock and then provides finacial information in return.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO -I hope to accomplish the portfolio optimization part of the project.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

TODO - If we have extra time, We want to import the code into a website format.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

TODO - I will need to learn different import and function like pandas in order to complete the project. I have to research more on stock and finanical function to have a better understanding. My partner and i will work together on every aspect of the project, this will ensure that both of us are understand and satisifed with the project. Splitting the project up will not work in my own opinion, but working alone on part of coded will be required, however we will always check in with one another to give each more idea of how we can improve.
